# Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of computer science and artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It involves the study and analysis of natural language (such as human language) to enable machines to understand, interpret, and process linguistic data.

The primary goal of NLP is to bridge the gap between human language and machines, making language data accessible and usable for computer systems. This process includes the development of algorithms and models for tasks such as text parsing, information extraction, machine translation, text generation, sentiment analysis, and other language-related tasks.

NLP plays a significant role in areas such as artificial intelligence, natural language processing, robotics, e-commerce, data analysis, and other practical domains.
