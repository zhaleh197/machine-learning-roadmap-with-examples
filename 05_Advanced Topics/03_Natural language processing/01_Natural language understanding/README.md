2. Open source ecosystem:
    NLTK
    The Natural Language Toolkit, or more commonly NLTK, is a suite of libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical natural language processing (NLP) for English written in the Python programming language. It supports classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning functionalities

    SpaCy
    spaCy is an open-source software library for advanced natural language processing. The library is published under the MIT license
    Unlike NLTK, which is widely used for teaching and research, spaCy focuses on providing software for production usage.
    spaCy also supports deep learning workflows that allow connecting statistical models trained by popular machine learning libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch or MXNet through its own machine learning library Thinc.
