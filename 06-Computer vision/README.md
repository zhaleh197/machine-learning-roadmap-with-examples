# Image Classification vs Image Segmentation vs Object Detection

Image Classification, Image Segmentation, and Object Detection are three different tasks in the field of computer vision:

Image Classification: Image classification involves assigning a label or a category to an entire image. It aims to determine the main object or the overall content of the image. For example, classifying an image as a cat or a dog.

Image Segmentation: Image segmentation refers to dividing an image into multiple segments or regions based on the pixel-level classification. Each pixel in the image is assigned a label or category to identify the object or region it belongs to. Image segmentation provides more detailed information about the object boundaries and shapes within an image. For example, segmenting an image to identify the different objects or regions present, such as cars, pedestrians, or background.

Object Detection: Object detection involves both classifying and localizing objects within an image. It aims to identify and locate multiple objects of interest within the image and draw bounding boxes around them. Object detection provides information about the presence, location, and class of objects in the image. For example, detecting and localizing multiple cars, pedestrians, or traffic signs within an image.

In summary, image classification focuses on assigning a single label to an entire image, image segmentation involves pixel-level classification to identify different regions or objects in an image, and object detection combines classification and localization to detect and locate multiple objects within an image.
